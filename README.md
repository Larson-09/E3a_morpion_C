# morpion_project_c

Here is the repository of our first semester C language project in the ESEO which is a Morpion (Tic-Tac-Toe Shakespeare language)

To execute the different parts of the code :
    1) Go in "Makefiles" directory --> "cd Makefiles"
    2) Execute the chosen makefile -->  "make -f <the name of the make file you want to execute>"

Enjoy !!
