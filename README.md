# morpion_project_c

Here is the repository of our 5th semester C language project in the ESEO which is a Morpion (Tic-Tac-Toe Shakespeare language).
This project was made to teach us how to use callback functions and conditional compilation

To execute the code :
    1) Go in Makefiles directory --> cd Makefile
    2) Execute the Makefile --> make -f Makefile_tictactoe
    3) Launch the executable file --> ./tictactoe_exe

Enjoy !!
