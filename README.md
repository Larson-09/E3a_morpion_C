# morpion_project_c

Here is the repository of our 5th semester C language project in the ESEO which is a Morpion (Tic-Tac-Toe Shakespeare language)

To execute the different parts of the code :
    1) Go in "Makefiles" directory --> "cd Makefiles"
    2) Use one of these commands to execute the chosen file :
        - isGameFinished tests --> make -f Makefile_test_tictactoe
        - step 1 with a cross win --> make -f Makefile_etape1_mock_CROSSWINS     
        - step 1 with a circle win --> make -f Makefile_etape1_mock_CIRCLEWINS     
        - step 1 with a draw --> make -f Makefile_etape1_mock_DRAW
        - step 2 --> make -f Makefile_etape2_scanf 
        - step 3 --> make -f Makefile_etape3_sdl

Each command will compile the code and launch the executable file.

Enjoy !!
